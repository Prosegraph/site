        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>One of the key problems medium-sized publishers face today is retaining reader engagement and loyalty for their digital offerings. Comment sections offered by the likes of OpenWeb and Disqus suffer from difficult customizability, high maintenance cost and low quality engagement, leading to many small publishers disabling comment sections.</p>
